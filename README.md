## Overview
A site for running a course matching algorithm demonstration - [link to the algorithm code](https://github.com/Course-Match/course_match_algorithm/tree/ab31cf46bce530eb6e554391d834faccbbe92389/fairpyx/algorithms/course_match).
The Course Match Algorithm is designed to efficiently match students to their desired courses while considering constraints such as course capacities and prerequisites. This problem is crucial in educational institutions to ensure a fair and optimal allocation of courses to students.

## Features
- **Student Preference Optimization:** The algorithm optimizes the matching process to maximize student satisfaction based on their preferences.
- **Constraint Handling:** Takes into account various constraints, such as course capacities and prerequisites.
- **Interactive Interface:** The project includes an interactive web interface where users can run the algorithm and view the results.

## Online App:
